# Installation

## Pre-compiled binaries

Pre-compiled binaries are the fastest and easiest way to get _qax_. To get the latest version,
use the following command, otherwise check the
[stable releases](https://github.com/telatin/bamtocov/releases).  


## Install via Miniconda

```note
Miniconda installation has been tested on MacOS and Linux,
but being _qax_ a single binary, if the precompiled works for you we recommend it.
```

Alternatively, you can install _bamtocov_ from BioConda, if you have _conda_ installed:

```
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda bamtocov
```
